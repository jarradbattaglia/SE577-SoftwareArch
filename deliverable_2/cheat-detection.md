# ADR 5: Using third party cheat detection software

Online games in the industry have a rampant problem of players cheating and most online games either use a proprietary solution that they build for their game or use of the shelf licensed tools that offer a general range of protection.  To fully create a robust anti cheat solution, we need to decide to build our own solution or license from the outside.

# Decision

We will use and decide on a third party solution later, but will not build our own client side anti-cheat

# Rationale



# Status

Accepted

# Consequences

Describe here the resulting context, after applying the decision. All consequences should be listed, not just the "positive" ones.
