Modeling software architectures is an essential activity to aligning key stakeholders in most projects.  Many times models are really just pictures, and dont add much value unless the author is available to present their point of view.  Simon Brown is the creator of the C4 model and has some interesting perspectives on effective modeling of software architectures.   One thing Simon claims is that a common set of abtractions are better than a standardized notation. 

WHAT TO HAND IN: After viewing the video below, do you think the abstractions (and the context around the abtractions) in the C4 model is an appropriate way to communicate software architecture information to both technical and non-technical stakeholders?  Please provide one paragraph to support your point of view.

Also, what challenges do you see with the C4 model, if any, when being used on large modern systems that may have thousands of components?
