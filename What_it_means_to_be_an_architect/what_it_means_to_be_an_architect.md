While this course will be learning about software architecture, an important part of being an architect in Industry is being able to connect technical work to product work.  

For this assignment, watch this video from AWS Re:Invent 2022:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goYiaIGebFo

In this video Gregor Hoppe talks about the importance and misunderstanding of the role of an architect, and some techniques architects need to master to be effective.

After watching this video, answer the following prompt with no more than a few paragraphs to one page - you will see I am a fan of conciseness throughout this term:

Describe one thing you found the most insightful with respect to the profession of being an architect, the skillset required for an architect, or the the day in and day out role of being a modern architect (you can pick one of these or blend them in your response)
```

# Answer

I think the one thing I found insightful is the need to be able to speak in terms that more than one team needs to think of (especially speaking outside of technical terms).  Throughout the video he discusses the idea of needing to think in layers and shades and he originally poses it as a technical problem.  For instance, your application needs a frontend, backend, database layer, etc.  But then kind of flips that and poses the idea that the same structure and problems exist at an organizational level and how there is a need to explain/demystify your decision to others at different organizational levels.  And the language needed to speak to each level is different from the next.  As I have started growing in my career I have also noticed the same things, where I believe I have a good design for the problem, but as I make larger solutions the need to communicate with others higher up or in different organizations becomes more important.  

As I am asked more to design our/my product and the need to create tickets, speak with scrum masters, internal customers, directors and lower level engineers increases.  I see the requirement architects need to have about talking about the cost or goals of a project I have with a director is different from one I might have with an engineer, but having the knowledge to know how I can "connect the dots''/translate to each use case is vitally important for an architect.  Understanding the perspective of others in different levels of the organization is required for an architect to make good decisions as knowing their needs increases your products chance of success as everyone is informed how your decision ties back to their goals and informs you of any decisions that may make your project fail (more customers than you think, different locations, govt rules, security, etc). 

In regards to the actual structure of a team, Gregor talks of the potential issues of being in the ivory tower and really just making decisions without the input of others (and he goes into his own opinion on team structures).  But I agree with this as I have seen it personally in my work, as I have seen previous lead engineers/architects make design decisions (for instance using bare metal instead of cloud or building KVMs instead of going to AWS or private cloud).  And that has driven more work for us now and slowing down production (we need to move to the cloud as KVMs have more downtime/rigid or we need to move to a cloud environment for our database as bare metal hardware deployments are slow and we want to move to international markets, where we don't own data centers).  If our previous architect wasn't sitting in his ivory tower making decisions by himself, he would have seen these issues pop up and instituted a better design in my opinion.  

Overall I think this video did an excellent job of emphasizing an architect's need to truly know how each decision they make affects not only the technical issues the product may face, but also the non-technical ones and being able to keep as many options open for their team as possible.
