# Prompt


```
While this course will be learning about software architecture, an important part of being an architect in Industry is being able to connect technical work to product work.  

For this assignment, watch this video from AWS Re:Invent 2022:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goYiaIGebFo

In this video Gregor Hoppe talks about the importance and misunderstanding of the role of an architect, and some techniques architects need to master to be effective.

After watching this video, answer the following prompt with no more than a few paragraphs to one page - you will see I am a fan of conciseness throughout this term:

Describe one thing you found the most insightful with respect to the profession of being an architect, the skillset required for an architect, or the the day in and day out role of being a modern architect (you can pick one of these or blend them in your response)
```
