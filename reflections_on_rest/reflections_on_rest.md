# Prompt 


Please read this paper:  https://github.com/ArchitectingSoftware/SE577-SoftwareArchitecture/blob/main/reading/reflections-on-rest.pdf

This paper is an update on a paper describing the REST Architecture Style after 17 years of practice.

Based on what you learned in this class, your personal experience, and reading this paper, briefly describe why you think this architecture style/patten has stood the test of time.  I would argue its still one of the most popular API architectures in 2022, and very few things have this long of a lifespan in computing.
